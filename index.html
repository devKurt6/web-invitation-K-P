                <h4>How We Met</h4>
                <p>It all began in 2021, during the pandemic, in our second year at Tanauan City College.
                    Classes were online, and we never thought real connections could grow through a screen‚Äîbut
                    one ordinaryconversation changed everything.
                    It started with a simple talk about our subjects, then slowly turned into something deeper.
                    We began sharing stories about our families,our faith, and the little things that made us
                    who we are. Paola spoke about her beliefs, and Kurt‚Äôs curiosity led him to attend church‚Äîwhere
                    something beautiful quietly began to bloom.
                    Days turned into months, and friendship turned into something special. From two people who met
                    online during a pandemic, guided by faith and strengthened by love‚Äîwe‚Äôre now here, ready to
                    begin the next chapter of our story together.</p>

                <h4>First Date</h4>
                <p>Paola thought our first date was at McDonald‚Äôs, because we shared a table just the two of us, even
                    though classmates were around. It felt special to her, a little moment just for us. But the official
                    first date really happened at WalterMart and Tanauan Plaza, just before Kurt‚Äôs birthday‚Äîa day of
                    bonding, laughter, eating ice cream, and sharing stories, marking the true beginning of something
                    beautiful.</p>

                <h4>The Proposal</h4>
                <p>On May 31, 2025, at the Manila Temple, Kurt, with the help of Paola‚Äôs family, planned a beautiful
                    surprise that Paola never saw coming. She couldn‚Äôt believe what was happening as Kurt knelt down and
                    held out a ring that said forever. In that unforgettable moment, he asked ‚Äî and her heart said
